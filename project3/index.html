    <h1>Untitled Music Thing</h1>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>A little 2d music experience where the user can click on certain objects for them to make sounds at a 
        chosen interval, akin to my singing monsters or other online music creation platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>Asethethics</h2>
    <p>2d pixel graphics most likely. Sounds used will be very simple and probably be common chiptune sounds.
    </p>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>Music</p>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop only</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Player will make music using the sounds I provide by setting intervals between beats and length of beats and any other interactions
