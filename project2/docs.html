    <h1>Project 2 Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <h3>What the hell do I make?</h3>
    <p>As with any creative project deciding on a topic is often the most difficult part of the entire project.
        I didn't want to use any of the provided APIs because they didn't appeal to me, so I scoured through some of the
        internet services which I utilize and came upon a site that I frequently use for learning Japanese vocabulary called
        WaniKani. I realized that the website had an API and after looking through the documentation a bit and fidgeting with 
        the documentation a little bit I was able to get a response from the API.
    </p>
    <h3>How the hell do I make this?</h3>
    <p>As I had never used an API to get data before &lpar;Save for the GIPHY API assignment &rpar; I had to figure out how to 
        sort through the API data to get the search information that I wanted. The information that the WaniKani API is also
        already in a JSON form so it was easy enough to read the data, the main problem was searching through it. Since I wasn't
        too confident on using the xhr and json searching things from the GIPHY assignment with a different API I fell back on 
        something that I was used to doing, which was looping. Though there is a lot of information to loop through on searches 
        (6000 results!) the site still does the process nearly instantly, so maybe a couple thousand isn't actually that intensive
        for a computer... I also figured that instead of talking to the API each time a search was made, it would be much more 
        efficient to get all the data beforehand, on load, and then just loop and search through the information I already had stored.
        This didn't impact loading the site either. After that I just had the function create html elements that contained the different
        information that each entry contains to display the information that is important to each entry.
