<ul>
    <li>The goal of the page is as an advertisement for both the phase 1 and phase 2 since in phase 1 it is an ad for intel
        to encourage people to apply for jobs at their company. And in phase 2 it would be an ad for a made upi product. For 
        phase 2 the intended audience would probably be the average person so it would aim to have mass appeal and make the product
        seem like something that everyone should have.

<li>The first thing that I had to tackle was how I was going to seperate the page into its main components</li>
<img src="src/initialidea.jpg" alt="Initial grid layout mockup" style="width: 300px;height:auto">
<li>I was going to go with this initially but then I realized that it would be too many grid lines which would make it much more
    difficult to manage the lines and all the boxes that are in the layout
</li>

<li>Deciding to seperate the page into three main sections, I created an overall grid which contained the three main parts of the
    page and then seperated the main content area as a grid into a 7 by 9 grid and used the divs that I made in my html to create 
    boxes in the grid. The numbers in green were used for calculating the fractional size that I wanted to have for the grid boxes.
    I used the image below to box out the areas that I needed for the grid.
</li>

<li>To get the polygon shape that some of the boxes have I had to create addition divs that used hte same color as the irregularly
    shaped boxes then then apply a nengative top margin to them to make it look like they connected.
</li>

<li>
    my sketch for the responsive layout of the page.
