            <p>
                Hi! My name is David Gao and I am a Game Design and Development and English Double Major! 
                My double major allows me to pursue the creation of the things that I've enjoyed for most of
                my life, and hope to bring for others to enjoy too, whether it be in video games, film, television, 
                or books. I just want to acquire for myself the knowledge to put out something that I can be proud
                of. I'm hoping that this class will give me the skills to do stuff. My time at RIT will hopefully 
                pull me together enough to gain the skils to fulfill my dreams, and when I graduate I hope that
                I'll be creating for the rest of my life!
            </p>
